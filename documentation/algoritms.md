+ trees
    





windows sizing:

Sorting:
any  sort can be represented as a decision tree and it would take at least nlog(n) time, in the case of integers
it would take approximatelly o(n)
worst case is the height of the tree
for integers, counting sort:
    count the elements, create a array of that size and put the elements in the index and increase the count for each index
radix sort: cool sorting that sorts the digits of a number  starting for the least significant one and then follow by the others until it is sort
recursion: 



tabulation:
go from the base case and go to the destiny solution 
    0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - destination state

memoization: recursion + remember the subproblems  + guessing
